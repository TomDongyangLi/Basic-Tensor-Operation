Main Goal: 
    Build my own library of tensor tools
    Compare all the code I have with the packages like tensorly, TensorNetwork, ttpy, t3f, etc; 
    Improve my own coding skill in the filed of Tensor

Objects:
    1. Tensor Decomposition
        a. TensorTrain
        b. Tucker
        c. CP
        d. More

    2. Tensor Operation
        a. unfolding
        b. 
    
    

What to compare:
    1. Speed
    2. Accuracy
    3. Simplicity
    4. convention
