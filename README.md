# Basic-Tensor-Operation

Main Goal: Build my own library of tensor tools Compare all the code I have with the packages like tensorly, TensorNetwork, ttpy, t3f, etc; Improve my own coding skill in the filed of Tensor

Objects: 

- Tensor Decomposition 
    a. TensorTrain 
    b. Tucker 
    c. CP 
    d. More
- Tensor Operation
    a. unfolding
    b. 

What to compare: 
    1. Speed 
    2. Accuracy 
    3. Simplicity 
    4. convention
