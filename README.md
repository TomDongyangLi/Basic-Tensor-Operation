# Basic-Tensor-Operation

Main Goal: Build my own library of tensor tools Compare all the code I have with the packages like tensorly, TensorNetwork, ttpy, t3f, etc; Improve my own coding skill in the filed of Tensor

Objects: 

- Tensor Decomposition 
    - TensorTrain
    - Tucker
    - CP
    - More
- Tensor Operation
    - unfolding
    - Mode n Product 

- What to compare: 
    - Speed 
    - Accuracy 
    - Simplicity 
    - convention
